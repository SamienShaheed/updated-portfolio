# Snake Game AI with Genetic Algo and Neural Networks

This project brings a modern twist to the classic Snake game by implementing AI techniques using genetic algorithms and neural networks. The system evolves its gameplay strategy over time, learning to navigate the game environment more efficiently with each generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Gameplay**: Utilizes genetic algorithms and neural networks to evolve strategies for playing Snake.
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Implements selection, crossover, and mutation to improve performance over generations.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Employs neural networks to make real-time decisions based on game state.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the AI learn and adapt as it plays the game.
- **Open Source**: Fully documented and available for contributions and further enhancements.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **AI & Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch for neural network implementation
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Custom algorithms for evolving game strategies
- **Game Framework**: Pygame for game development and visualization

## Implementation

### Genetic Algorithm

- **Population Initialization**: Generate an initial population of game agents with random neural network weights.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Score each agent based on its performance (e.g., length of snake, game score).
- **Selection & Breeding**: Select top-performing agents to breed new generations via crossover and mutation.

### Neural Network

- **Decision Making**: Feed game state data into a neural network to determine the next move.
- **Training**: Use backpropagation along with evolutionary techniques to refine the network's performance over time.

### Game Mechanics

- **Game Loop**: Continuously update game state, evaluate AI decisions, and render the game.
- **Interactive UI**: Visual interface built with Pygame that displays the evolving strategies and game progress.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Start with a randomly generated population of AI agents.
2. **Gameplay**: Each agent plays the Snake game, with its performance recorded.
3. **Evolution**: Apply genetic algorithms to breed the next generation of agents.
4. **Iteration**: Repeat the process, with each generation ideally performing better than the last.
5. **Visualization**: Watch the evolutionary process unfold in real-time as the game progresses.

## Future Enhancements

- Experiment with different neural network architectures for improved decision-making.
- Integrate additional evolutionary strategies to enhance learning speed.
- Optimize the game mechanics for smoother, faster gameplay.
- Expand the project to include other classic games with AI-driven adaptations.
