# Nuclei Extraction using Image Processing

This project leverages advanced image processing techniques to accurately extract nuclei from microscopic images. Designed with biomedical researchers and imaging specialists in mind, it provides a robust solution for segmenting and analyzing cell nuclei.

## Features

- **Automated Detection**: Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to detect nuclei.
- **Robust Segmentation**: Applies thresholding, morphological operations, and contour detection for precise extraction.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrates into existing biomedical imaging pipelines.
- **Open Source**: Community-driven with continuous enhancements and contributions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, scikit-image
- **Numerical Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib for displaying results and debugging

## Implementation

### Preprocessing

- **Enhancement**: Improve image quality using filters and noise reduction techniques.
- **Normalization**: Standardize image intensities to ensure consistent segmentation.

### Segmentation

- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Differentiate nuclei from the background effectively.
- **Morphological Operations**: Use dilation and erosion to refine nuclei boundaries.
- **Contour Extraction**: Identify and extract the outlines of individual nuclei.

### Post-Processing

- **Validation**: Overlay extracted nuclei on original images for accuracy checks.
- **Data Export**: Save segmentation results for downstream analysis or machine learning tasks.

## How It Works

1. **Input Image**: Load microscopy images containing cell nuclei.
2. **Preprocessing**: Enhance and normalize the images.
3. **Segmentation**: Automatically detect and extract nuclei.
4. **Output**: Visualize or export the extracted nuclei for further analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate deep learning models for enhanced segmentation accuracy.
- Develop real-time processing for large datasets.
- Enhance visualization with interactive dashboards.
